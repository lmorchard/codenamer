# Codenamer

I wanted a quick and dirty thing to generate random codenames for projects. This is it.

I borrowed the JSON list of words from [mong](https://github.com/toshihikoyanase/mong), which in turn generated it from [moby](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go).
